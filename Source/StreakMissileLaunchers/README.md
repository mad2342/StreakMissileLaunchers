# Streak Missile Launchers

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Adds short range Streak Missile Launchers to Battletech. Includes Streak SRM-2, Streak SRM-4 and Streak SRM-6 launchers. Includes VFX for targeting lasers.

## Details
- Implements Streak SRMs according to the ruleset described at sarna.net
    - Launchers send out a targeting laser pulse (this is borrowed from the vanilla small pulse laser)
    - If the lock-on succeeds *all* missiles of the corresponding launcher are garantueed to hit their target
    - If the lock-on fails no missile will be fired and the ammo is preserved
    - Small text floaties will give feedback on the target lock
- Streaks (as their specialized ammunition) can potentially be found on any starsystem with former starleague presence

## Notes
- Streak SRM-4 and Streak SRM-6 launchers aren't canon but with Heavy Metal, what is?
